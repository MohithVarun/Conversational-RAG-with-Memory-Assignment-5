Treatment for the common cold focuses on symptom management since there is no cure for the viral infection. Effective management includes adequate rest, increased fluid intake, humidification to ease congestion, saltwater gargles for sore throat relief, and over-the-counter medications such as decongestants and pain relievers. Nasal irrigation with saline solutions can help clear nasal passages, while steam inhalation may provide temporary relief from congestion.
 
Prevention strategies are crucial in reducing the frequency of colds. These include frequent hand washing, avoiding touching the face, maintaining distance from sick individuals, getting adequate sleep, maintaining good nutrition, and considering annual flu vaccination. While the flu vaccine doesn't prevent colds, it helps distinguish between cold and flu symptoms and prevents complications.
 
It's important to note that antibiotics are not effective against viral infections like the common cold and should only be used when a bacterial infection is confirmed. Overuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance and other complications.

Symptoms typically last 1-2 weeks, with fatigue potentially persisting longer.

Treatment focuses on symptom management and includes rest, increased fluid intake, over-the-counter fever reducers and pain relievers, and antiviral medications if prescribed within 48 hours of symptom onset. Antiviral drugs like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) can reduce severity and duration when taken early.

Prevention is crucial and includes annual flu vaccination, frequent hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, covering coughs and sneezes, and maintaining good overall health. The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months and older, especially high-risk groups like young children, elderly adults, pregnant women, and those with chronic health conditions.

Symptoms can range from mild to severe and often interfere with daily activities and sleep quality. Seasonal allergies are most common during spring and fall when pollen counts are highest.

Management strategies include avoiding allergens when possible, using over-the-counter antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal sprays, and considering prescription medications for more severe cases. Immunotherapy (allergy shots or sublingual tablets) can provide long-term relief for some individuals.

Prevention measures include monitoring pollen counts, keeping windows closed during high pollen periods, using air purifiers, showering after outdoor activities, and wearing sunglasses to protect eyes from pollen. Regular cleaning and vacuuming can also help reduce indoor allergens.
